        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999,
            highlighting stories of coffee from around the world. We have
            since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to
            brew - in every shipment.

            <h3>Our commitment</h3>

            <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a
                commitment to doing good along the way.
                We want to make it easy for you to discover
                and brew the world’s best coffee at home.
                It all starts at the source. To locate the
                specific lots we want to purchase, we travel
                nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
                challenges and opportunities in each of these places.
                We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and
                empower a global community of farmers through with
                well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training,
                support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee
                plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast
                each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to
                their native growing region.</p>

        <h2>Uncompromising quality</h2>

        <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention
            to all stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end,
            a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or
            baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with
            a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent,
            user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
